## Custom App
General rules:
1. Position important and mandatory fields in top left
2. Have less than 6 fields in a section
3. Default values
4. All related items in dashboard
5. Section headings designate new sections
6. Avoid buttons; fetch automatically on select instead. If required, place in toolbar
7. Functions and methods need to be less than 10 lines of code. Anything larger needs to become a class.

Doctype Naming Is Title Case And Singular
Child Table Naming requires the parent doctype to be named, followed by the relation

Field Names Are Title Case, Link Name == Doctype Name
Table names are plural, only relation.
Vars must be descriptive

### Creating Doctypes
Don't check 'custom?' as this is only for users without access to server-side operations
