# PCB Assembly Business Venture
## Introduction
Before starting DAAS Inc I was looking for a way to invest my extra time and energy into a project that could generate consistent returns. My previous projects included buying, restoring, riding, and selling motorcycles on Craigslist, and a short term rental property via [[blog.airbnb]]. It was fun but it wasn't the kind of thing that encouraged me to set up systems to scale the processes. Of course in hindsight there are many things I could have done that would have been much more successful than this venture, but I'm not sure the same level of exposure to larger businesses and their workings would have been achieved had I not chosen to pursue electronics manufacturing. 
While I was looking at Craigslist for my next project, kind of thinking about tow trucks and a weekend towing company, I found a SMT line up for liquidation. It was listed for $10,000, and in the description it specified $1,000, worth $10,000 to the discerning buyer. Thinking it was a typo I asked what the price was, and upon hearing the smaller number I called up rental company to borrow a trailer to go pick up the assets. Of course this was an emotional decision driven by my excitement to be hands on with these machines that I know usually cost seemingly exorbitant amounts. The logic to justify this was that I could at least resell them, or if they work well enough, start a business. My subconsious had already made that decision. 
## The Pick and Place
The crown jewel (which became the biggest PiTA) of the operation was an early 00s/late 90s Samsung CP40. By one of my incredible strokes of luck, someone was in town who knew what this machine was. One of the first times I turned it on, they visited my garage and pressed the right buttons to verify the aligners worked and the axes homed. After this, it was a slow process of disassembling, cleaning, and reassembling mechanical parts and identifying faulty actuators. Once the machine was clean enough that garage dust was a hindrance to maintaining that state, I began searching for its new home. This came in the form of a friend of a friend who had a small business with shop space I could rent. A $200 telehandler relocation got that situated, and I was able to continue the restoration in the more suitable environment. This is where I should have attempted to gain manufacturing customers and complete some jobs or create the asset listings to sell everything. I was able to build a couple small runs of boards for a local business and even though the machine didn't work very well, I assumed it was due to a combination of my inexperience or a couple more parts that had to be repalced. Either way, it would improve as time went on and my main focus should be on getting the rest of the equipment set up, or so I thought.
## The Trailer Shop
The machines needed at least 40'x8'. Most commercial property that is 40' in one direction will be close to that in the other, and I couldn't afford any of those options, not to mention power requirements. Other spaces that provided that area were sea containers and semi trailers. Sea containers were around the same price and much less mobile (since of course I'd be moving out soon after my line was running thousands of boards for all my customers...). Finding a 48' dry van for $2000 on trusty Craigslist solved this problem, and after a $700 relocation fee plus $2000 of insualtion and electrical gear, it was ready for the machines. I found a place to park it on the edge of town with cheap rent and sufficient power, and with more help from my new landlords' forklifts and big trailers, we managed to get everything inside. Now the real fun can begin.
## The First Customer
I formed DAAS Inc as an S-Corp in December of 2019, and began the marketing effort by creating business listings in every available manufacturing directory. I got my first exposure to web development by customizing a html/css template and adding some js / php calculations for an instant quote page, the formula for which I found from another manufactuer's page and modified. After creating social media pages, I found a small electronic device being sold by a maker and I reached out about their supplier. They agreed to a short run which I ended up discounting, I ordered components, completed the job without much hassle, and jubilantly shipped off the first finished product.
## Owner-Operator
A few production managers and other small business owners acutally found my website and submitted their information, and we were able to develop relationships. My pricing was initially loss leading to form those connections, and after some months of satisfaction and struggles on my end, I raised prices to what my instant quoter provided. Things were looking up and there were a few repeat customers whos orders allowed me to step back and start looking at bottlenecks to automate. The first one was getting their files formatted for the placement machine, and then automating part sourcing and quoting via Octopart's excel add in. This worked well but I knew other companies had better solutions and automating the excel process would only go so far. I was also able to find a couple people who had experience with electronics and were interested in working at the shop, and they did a great job all things considered. Between realizing I needed some kind of program to keep track of data and make API requests, hiring and training people to take over so I could leave town for school, and also realizing the equipment issues I was able to work around were crippling my trainee's productivity, there was an endless amount of work to tackle. 
## Scale Fail 
With all of this, I determined that Python would be the answer - a Django webapp accessible from our phones, the shop PC, or any raspberry pi that would be setup for various duties in the future. Then I dug deeper and saw that the world of software engineering was another incredible ecosystem that was way over my head. Luckily, something already existed that could handle everything I wanted to do: ERPNext - the erp system that's easy to customize and can do everything my business would need. All I had to do was make a plugin for Octopart and transfer over my quoting process, automate the placement file setup, and we'd be able to manage the increased capacity of new equipment. So, now that there were two part time employees with some experience, I left town for school while they continued to fulfill existing customers' repeat orders. Unfortunately, the equipment issues proved too big to work around, affecting quality and making perfect line changeovers impossible for someone without years of experience. There was one customer who just had repeat orders, and if we stopped supplying to everyone else, I figured we
