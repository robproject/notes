<h3 id="the-beginning">The Beginning<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#the-beginning"></a></h3>
<p>As a young electronics technician apprentice with stable income in a small town circa 2017, I was able to afford a small 2b2b house. Shortly after moving in, a close friend rented the other room, and we talked about how hosting guests with our couch on AirBnB could be interesting.</p>
<h3 id="how-it-went">How it Went<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#how-it-went"></a></h3>
<p>I posted a listing and within a couple months, all kinds of interesting professionals and tourists were booking the couch. We had mostly 5-star reviews for an affordable $20 per night.</p>
<p>My flat mate moved out after some months so of course I added the new vacancy to our offerings, resulting in overlapping stays where guests occupied the couch and room simultaneously. That was mostly fine, and the situation was clearly described in the listings, however it sometimes led to unusual moments where a couple or family of 3 would show up for the room and find someone camped out in the living room (obviously this was bound to happen). The couch was removed from the offerings to prevent any further confusion.</p>
<p>At this point things were perfect and I continued to meet amazing people from all over the world. The next step was to rent both rooms to maximize income and prepare for another venture which ended up being <a href="/notes/4zio7z0s9fy1d310wxhrbhx">DAAS Inc</a>. Insulating the garage, installing a window AC, and setting up a bed enabled this. The only issue left was eliminating check-in and check-out buffers between stays, which were preventing a month from getting completely booked. The answer for this was finding someone from a local social media group who came in and cleaned for $15 per room on their lunch break from their hotel-cleaning day-job. The system was working perfectly until Covid halted most bookings.</p>
<p>Because having the cleaner visit daily was only worthwhile when they serviced both rooms simultaneously and the lack of nightly stays meant they'd only be coming in occasionally for single bookings, booking requirements were changed to not accept durations shorter than three days. Since overnight stays were filtered out, remaining guests were temporary professionals with whom I set up leases and payments directly. A travel nurse booking app was recommended by one guest, which proved to be a reliable source.</p>
<h3 id="how-its-going">How it's going<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#how-its-going"></a></h3>
<p>I set AirBnB minimum durations to 30 days and found a guest who converted to a tenant of the whole property, easing my move out of town for school.</p>
<h3 id="why-its-exciting">Why it's exciting<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#why-its-exciting"></a></h3>
<p>Meeting people from other parts of the world in my own home was mind-blowing at the time, particularly waking up to a variety of foreign languages coming from the kitchen. Learning about their cultures greatly influenced my own trajectory and was an incredible experience that was unlikely to happen in any path I had previously forecasted. Realizing the world is much smaller than it feels has encouraged me to focus my efforts on living a life that is the least environmentally impactful and most beneficial to others' wellbeing.</p>
