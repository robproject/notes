### The Beginning
As a young technician apprentice with stable income in a small town, I was able to afford a small house. Shortly after moving in, I had a close friend rent the other room and we decided that renting the couch out on AirBnB would be an amusing endeavor. Little did I know this would change my life.

### How it Went
My flatmate moved out after some months and I kept on hosting. All kinds of interesting professionals and tourists enjoyed the **couch**, leaving mostly 5 star reviews for their $20 stays. Of course the next step was to rent out the newly-vacant room as well, resulting in overlapping stays where I had guests occupying the couch and the room simultaneously. That was mostly fine, and the situation was clearly described in the listings, however it sometimes led to unusual situations where a couple or family of 3 would show up for the room and find someone camped out in the living room (obviously this situation was bound to happen but I was ~20 with an abundance of optimism and generally unimaginitive of edge cases). So, to mitigate this I discontinued the couch and only rented the room. This was perfect and I continued to meet amazing people from all over the world. After having it go so smoothly, the next step was clearly to optimize the process and find a way to rent both rooms. Insulating the garage, installing a window AC, and setting up a bed allowed me to move in and realize this. The only issue left was having check-in and check-out buffers between stays, preventing a month from getting completely booked. The solution to this was paying someone from a local Facebook group to come in and clean for $15 per room, which was perfect since she came and took care of it on her lunch break from her hotel-cleaning job, until Covid halted all bookings. To make up for my lack of cleaning staff, I changed booking requirements to be longer than 3 days in the hopes of getting longer term guests. This also worked well, and I ended up with some professionals who would book for the week they would be in town over the course of some months, and we developed relationships outside of the app so they could pay me directly. I discovered Furnished Finder as well from one guest, which led to a few longer term stays from medical professionals who could tell me about their experiences with Covid from the front lines. This went well for the last year I was there, and after the last of those guests I got my final guest from Airbnb.

### How it's going
My final guest converted to a tenant, which has allowed me to step away from the more granular management of short-term stays, and things are going smoothly.

### Why it's exciting
Meeting people from other parts of the world in my own home was mind-blowing for someone like me at the time, particularly waking up to a variety of foreing languages coming from the kitchen. Learning about their cultures greatly influenced my own trajectory and was an incredible experience that was unlikely to happen in any path I had planned. Realizing the world is much smaller than it feels has encouraged me to focus my efforts on living a life that is the least impactful on the environment, and the most beneficial to others' wellbeing.
