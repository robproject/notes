### The Beginning
As a young electronics technician apprentice with stable income in a small town circa 2017, I was able to afford a small 2b2b house. Shortly after moving in, a close friend rented the other room and we decided hosting guests with our couch on AirBnB would be an amusing endeavor.

### How it Went
All kinds of interesting professionals and tourists enjoyed the couch, leaving mostly 5 star reviews for their $20 stays. My flatmate moved out after some months so of course I added the new vacancy to our offerings, resulting in overlapping stays where guests occupied the couch and room simultaneously. That was mostly fine, and the situation was clearly described in the listings, however it sometimes led to unusual moments where a couple or family of 3 would show up for the room and find someone camped out in the living room (obviously this was bound to happen). The couch was removed from the offerings to prevent any further confusion. At this point things were perfect and I continued to meet amazing people from all over the world. After having it go so smoothly, the next step was to rent both rooms to maximize income and prepare for another venture which ended up being [[blog.daas-inc]]. Insulating the garage, installing a window AC, and setting up a bed enabled this. The only issue left was eliminating check-in and check-out buffers between stays, which were preventing a month from getting completely booked. Someone from a local social media group came in and cleaned for $15 per room, which was perfect since they took care of it on their lunch break from their hotel-cleaning day-job. This worked perfectly until Covid halted all bookings and changed everything. To make up for my lack of cleaning staff and limited bookings, I changed booking requirements to be longer than 3 days. This filtered out overnight stays that would otherwise prevent longer term bookings, and I ended up with some professionals who would book for the weeks they would be in town over the course of their assignments, and we developed relationships outside of the app so they could pay me directly. A travel nurse booking app was recommended by one guest, which led to a few longer term stays from medical professionals. This went well for the last year I lived there.

### How it's going
My final guest converted to a long-term tenant of the whole property, and things are still going smoothly.

### Why it's exciting
Meeting people from other parts of the world in my own home was mind-blowing for someone like me at the time, particularly waking up to a variety of foreing languages coming from the kitchen. Learning about their cultures greatly influenced my own trajectory and was an incredible experience that was unlikely to happen in any path I had planned. Realizing the world is much smaller than it feels has encouraged me to focus my efforts on living a life that is the least environmentally impactful, and the most beneficial to others' wellbeing.
