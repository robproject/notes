## Differential Equations
### Steady State
When y'= 0 the DE is considered a steady state solution

### Classification
nth order DE determined by highest order derivative  
Linear 
* f(x)
* coefficients can't have y or y' (only x)
* y and all derivatives are 1st power

### General solution 
The solution to a DE that defines the slope field

### Unique solution
Specific solution of a DE found with initial conditions

### Method of Integrating Factor
for first order non-separable DE  
$\mu (x)$  
$y'+a(x)y = b(x)$


### Integration by parts
$\int udv = uv - \int vdu$
