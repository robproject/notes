## Sleep

Sleep is restorative. Sleep deprivation lowers resistance to stress, interferes with memory and learning, short-circuits attention, increases forgetfullnes, and generally makes the brain 'slower'.

One continuous sleep cycle is more beneficial than broken chunks that are frequently interrupted. 7-8 hours nightly is considered best.

## Learning

from https://legacybox.com/blogs/analog/10-incredible-facts-about-human-memory

1. There is no limit to what the brain can store (2.5 petabytes). One billion neurons, each having 1000 connections, summing to 1T connections.

2. Short term memory only holds a few things.

3. Learning things produces physical changes in structure. New skills manifest in activity variations as well as white and grey matter structural growth.

4. The internet makes remembering things less likely, as the brain knows these things are now easily accessible. 'The Google Effect'.

5. Possible to remember things that didn't happen

6. Testing for information is better than rehearsing or re-reading.

7. Partially forgetting increases ability to remember, as the act of recalling tells the brain that the information is important. 'Spaced Repetition'

8. Prenatal Memory 
Memories start at 4 months into pregnancy - fetuses remember sounds.

9. Memories don't live in a single place, especially at first. They're stored in a complex parallel web with different senses having their separate information stored. Consolidation occurs later https://www.human-memory.net/processes_consolidation.html

10. Emotional intensity pioritises memory storage. Charged events are remembered better, for longer, and with more accuracy. Dopamine is like a tag-system whose concentration prioritises importance.
