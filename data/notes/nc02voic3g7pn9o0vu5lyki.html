<p>High rises are tall buildings.<br>
Low rises are less high.<br>
A very tall high-rise is known as a skyscraper.  </p>

<p>Skyscrapers have double the carbon footprint of 10 storey building of same floor area (Tim Snelson in <em>Domus</em>)
20% higher operating energy (heating, cooling, elevators)</p>
<p>Density benefits depreciate after 10 or 12 storeys</p>
<p>Overall not good - more expensive, bad for environment, and inhospitable due to environmental constraints </p>

<p>In order of efficiency:<br>
Four storey with courtyard might be sweetspot<br>
Small triplex<br>
65 story high rise in third.<br>
Larger than 100 stories are bad due to the steel and concrete.  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>high-rises of 10 stories and higher used 76 percent
more electricity per square foot than low-rises of five
stories and under. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Suburbs are worse than both</p>
<p>Skyscrapers require large foundations, cant be built extremely close together in addition to reasons like privacy. Additionally skyscraper construction requires more energy intense processes and materials than low-rise. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>lifting people, air, water, and windows that leak heat/cold</p>
