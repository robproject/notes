<p>Sleep is restorative. Sleep deprivation lowers resistance to stress, interferes with memory and learning, short-circuits attention, increases forgetfullnes, and generally makes the brain 'slower'.</p>
<p>One continuous sleep cycle is more beneficial than broken chunks that are frequently interrupted. 7-8 hours nightly is considered best.</p>
<p>Body posture of sleeping on left side may more effectively remove waste</p>

<p>There is no limit to what the brain can store (2.5 petabytes). One billion neurons, each having 1000 connections, summing to 1T connections.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Short term memory only holds a few things.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Learning things produces physical changes in structure. New skills manifest in activity variations as well as white and grey matter structural growth.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The internet makes remembering things less likely, as the brain knows these things are now easily accessible. 'The Google Effect'.

<p>Possible to remember things that didn't happen</p>

<p>Testing for information is better than rehearsing or re-reading.

<p>Partially forgetting increases ability to remember, as the act of recalling tells the brain that the information is important. 'Spaced Repetition'

<p>Prenatal Memory
Memories start at 4 months into pregnancy - fetuses remember sounds.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Memories don't live in a single place, especially at first. They're stored in a complex parallel web with different senses having their separate information stored. Consolidation occurs later <a href="https://www.human-memory.net/processes_consolidation.html">https://www.human-memory.net/processes_consolidation.html</a></p>

<li>
<p>Emotional intensity pioritises memory storage. Charged events are remembered better, for longer, and with more accuracy. Dopamine is like a tag-system whose concentration prioritises importance.</p>
