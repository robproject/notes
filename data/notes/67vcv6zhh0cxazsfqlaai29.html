<p>ChromeOS boots fast, long battery on devices, works great for general purpose ie. only use it for google products and light work. Won't play nice with specific applications. When software updates become unavailable, it can be rooted and either converted to linux or a newer rom installed.</p>
<p>Mac is expensive, is not compatible with many kinds of hardware and software, but for things within its capability it works very well. The Apple ecosystem is tightly integrated and can result in an efficient setup for its users without requiring much configuration.</p>
<p>Linux is fast, efficient in its architecture, but with a less polished UX. Works well for development and light work, but might not run certain applications including MS Office products.</p>
<p>Windows has the least amount of compatibility issues being the dominant OS in the market.</p>
<h3 id="matlab-vs-python">Matlab vs Python<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#matlab-vs-python"></a></h3>
<p>Matlab is widely used by the scientific community and solutions are available for many problems. Plugins are free or paid and all managed by Mathworks. As a programming language, it isn't as 'utilitarian' and might be difficult to integrate with other projects. Its simulink features are unmatched given their specialized nature.</p>
<p>Python is an open source general purpose programming language and uses various libraries to extend its capability. Solutions for problems might not be as widely available but it seems to be gaining popularity.</p>
<p>Matlab is developed as a professional, mission-critical application and can be relied on in situations of that nature. Python might not always be the best application but is good enough for many things, although potentially not as reliable.</p>
