## Skyscrapers
High rises are tall buildings.  
Low rises are less high.  
A very tall high-rise is known as a skyscraper.  
### Measurement
Council of tall bulidings counts spires toward height, but not antennas

## Efficiency
Skyscrapers have double the carbon footprint of 10 storey building of same floor area (Tim Snelson in *Domus*)
20% higher operating energy (heating, cooling, elevators)

Density benefits depreciate after 10 or 12 storeys

Overall not good - more expensive, bad for environment, and inhospitable due to environmental constraints

In order of efficiency:   
Four storey with courtyard might be sweetspot     
Small triplex   
65 story high rise in third.   
Larger than 100 stories are bad due to the steel and concrete.  

> high-rises of 10 stories and higher used 76 percent 
> more electricity per square foot than low-rises of five 
> stories and under. 

Suburbs are worse than both

Skyscrapers require large foundations, cant be built extremely close together in addition to reasons like privacy. Additionally skyscraper construction requires more energy intense processes and materials than low-rise. 

>lifting people, air, water, and windows that leak heat/cold

10 story threshold that shouldn't be exceeded unless necessary
