This desire manifested in the formation of Desert Automated Assembly Service Incorporated. My previous projects included buying, restoring, and selling motorcycles on Craigslist, and <a href=\"/notes/wd2g90i9743puwg70rzdzfv\">AirBnB</a>. In my mind, starting a business meant doing something big, and these other hobbies didn't feel 'big'. In hindsight there are many things I could have done with these other interests with higher chances of success, but I'm not sure the same level of exposure to enterprise competition would have been achieved.\nWhile I was looking at Craigslist for a business-related project that could use my hands-on skillset, thinking about tow trucks and a weekend towing company, a SMT line up for liquidation appeared. It was listed for $10,000, and the description clarified the price was $1000, \"worth $10,000 to the discerning buyer\". I contacted the seller thinking it was a typo, and upon hearing the smaller number I called a rental company, borrowed a trailer, and in April 2019 acquired what was in hindsight, the most used electronics assembly line in the Western Hemisphere. Of course this was an emotional decision driven by my excitement to be hands on with these machines that usually cost seemingly exorbitant amounts. My justification was that they could at least be resold, or if they work well enough, be the start of a manufacturing business. My subconscious had already made that decision. </p>\n<h2 id=\"the-dream-machine\">The Dream Machine<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#the-dream-machine\"></a></h2>\n<p>The crown jewel (which became the biggest PiTA) of the operation was an early 00s/late 90s Samsung CP40. After verifying the aligners worked and the axes homed, the meticulous process of disassembling, cleaning, and reassembling mechanical parts and identifying faulty actuators began. Once the machine was clean enough that garage dust was a hindrance to maintaining that state, I began searching for its new home. This came in the form of a friend of a friend who had a small business with rentable shop space. A $200 telehandler relocation later I was able to continue the restoration in this more suitable environment (this is where I should have failed faster by attempting to gain more customers and automate business processes or create the asset listings to sell everything). I was able to build a couple small runs of boards for a local business and even though the machine didn't work perfectly, I assumed it was due to a combination of my inexperience or a couple more parts that had to be replaced. Either way, I decided it would improve as time went on and the focus should be on getting the remaining equipment set up.</p>\n<h2 id=\"mobile-factory\">Mobile Factory<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#mobile-factory\"></a></h2>\n<p>The machines needed at least 40'x8'. Most commercial property that is 40' in one direction will be close to that in the other, and I couldn't afford any of those options, not to mention power requirements. Other spaces which provided that area were sea containers and semi-trailers. Sea containers were around the same price and much less mobile (since of course I'd be moving out soon after my line was running thousands of boards for all my customers...). Finding a 48' dry van for $2000 on trusty Craigslist solved this problem, and after a $700 relocation fee plus $2000 of insulation and electrical gear, it was ready for machines. I found an affordable parking spot on the edge of town with sufficient power, and with more help from my new landlords' forklifts and big trailers, we managed to get everything inside. Now the real fun can begin.</p>\n<h2 id=\"customer-no-1\">Customer No. 1<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#customer-no-1\"></a></h2>\n<p>I formed DAAS Inc as an S-Corp in December of 2019 and began marketing by creating business listings in every available manufacturing directory. I got my first exposure to web development by customizing a html/CSS template and adding some JS / PHP calculations for an instant quote page, the formula for which I found from another manufacturerâ€™s page and modified. After creating social media pages, I found a small electronic device being sold by a maker and I reached out about their supplier. They agreed to a short run, I ordered components, completed the job without much hassle, and jubilantly shipped off the first finished product.</p>\n<h2 id=\"owner-operator\">Owner-Operator<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#owner-operator\"></a></h2>\n<p>A few production managers and other small business owners found my website and submitted their information, and we developed relationships. My pricing was initially loss leading to form those connections, and after some months of customer satisfaction and struggles on my end, the beginning of 2021 saw prices raised to what my instant quoter provided. Things were looking up and a few repeat customers allowed me to step back and look at bottlenecks to automate. The first one was formatting their placement files, and then part sourcing and quoting via Octopart's excel add in. This worked well enough to think about hiring, but I knew other companies had better solutions and automating the excel process would only go so far. Luckily, I found a couple people who had experience with electronics, and they did a great job over the next year all things considered. However, between looking for a robust way to keep track of data and make API requests for Octopart, training up two employees so I could leave town for school in Fall 2021, and seeing the equipment issues I was able to work around become mountainous hurdles for the new operators, the feeling of success was short lived. </p>\n<h2 id=\"scale-fail\">Scale Fail<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#scale-fail\"></a></h2>\n<p>With all of this, I determined that Python would be the answer to our quoting and csv transforming workflows - a Django webapp accessible from our phones, the shop PC, or any raspberry pi that would be setup for various duties in the future. A small amount of research showed that the skillset I needed was that of a software engineer, and this was the first time I started to grasp the software industry's vastness. Luckily, something already existed that could handle everything I wanted to do: ERPNext - a system that's easy to customize and is already implemented in similar businesses. All I had to do was make an app for Octopart and transfer over my quoting process, automate the placement file setup, and we could handle increased capacity from new equipment. So, now that there were two part time employees with some experience, I felt they would continue improving and it would be ok to leave town. Unfortunately, the equipment issues of the placement machine proved too big to work around even after multiple troubleshooting sessions, compromising quality and making productive line changeovers impossible for someone without years of experience. We had a small ai inspection camera which caught some of the issues, but between operators who were relatively new, and an uncertified process composed of legacy equipment, it was easy for mistakes to slip through. The quality issues occurring with our shorter run customers had no remedy, so that work ceased at the end of 2021.</p>\n<h2 id=\"maybe-maybe-not\">Maybe, Maybe Not<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#maybe-maybe-not\"></a></h2>\n<p>There was a single customer with recurring orders of a single design for which we could set up and optimize the line. Changeover delays would be eliminated as we wouldn't be dealing with supplier delays, kitting, short cut-tape, loading feeders, or program setup. This would generate enough income to keep someone employed part time while covering expenses, allowing the business to exist while I got the ERP software together. Except, the intermittent placement issues, inspection times, and the few quality issues magnified to keep success elusive.\nAfter trying a few batches of boards with this approach then implementing the inspection camera, replacing machine heads and aligners, and assembling some of the boards myself, assemblies were still failing the customer's inspection process halfway through 2022. At this stage I was set on optimizing our digital process so new machines could be managed effectively, but these operational issues halted that. </p>\n<h2 id=\"moving-forward\">Moving Forward<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#moving-forward\"></a></h2>\n<p>The customer needed a reliable source for their assemblies. I spent many weeks trying to improve our process, did not have a place to put new equipment, couldn't replace the placement machine due to the trailer construction besides the expense of a different machine, and although we might have been able to figure out a process in a new location, no savings were left to support mistakes. My ERP effort had progressed, we had an instance deployed in production, and I was familiar enough to install custom apps and start designing our business logic, but we still had much to do to get the basic functionality matching our existing process. I couldn't justify getting new equipment. A few quotes from other suppliers supported this decision, as one of them came in with a lower price, only produces class III product, and has been in business for decades. They have successfully taken over production.</p>\n<h2 id=\"debrief\">Debrief<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#debrief\"></a></h2>\n<p>DAAS Inc had its final transactions at the end of 2022, and the shutdown process commenced with updating all accounts in our new ERP, making our final tax filing, closing out bank accounts, and liquidating assets. This whole adventure was fueled by a bootstrapping mindset, thinking that taking issues day by day, solving problems one at a time, and putting in consistent effort would result in success. These things enabled the journey, and it did achieve the goal of being a successful learning experience, but in order to succeed in the traditional manner, a traditional approach should have been used. I had a vision of a reliable business being bootstrapped out of the mobile shop, with enough work to keep a few people busy full-time and turning out quality product to customers who need it asap. Obviously, equipment that costs next nothing will have proportional performance, and if it is going to be restored, the cost will equate to a restored used machine, well worth the price I tried to avoid. That was the hands-on technician mindset driven by gut feelings, and I'm grateful for this real-world introduction to the power of analysis.</p>\n<p>I knew manufacturing software would be overkill initially and excel would allow establishment of the physical process and related bottleneck discovery. Work could be performed and managed easily with a few spreadsheets, however, I underestimated how vaulable a tight integration is for any business. If a year of software development could have been squeezed into December 2019 such that the following year of successful jobs were traceable with integrated inventory, purchasing, shipping, accounting, and job setup workflows, that line would likely still have the same fate, but I'd have pie charts and graphs to show why. </p>\n<hr>\n<strong>Backlinks</strong>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/notes/5u88syeac813rvqauto8x7o\">Blog</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/notes/wd2g90i9743puwg70rzdzfv\">Airbnb</a></li>\n</ul>","noteIndex":{"id":"398cceh65hemaonxc6w22r7","title":"rodun","desc":"","updated":1673033072132,"created":1668995545797,"custom":{"nav_order":0,"permalink":"/"},"fname":"root","type":"note","vault":{"fsPath":".","selfContained":true,"name":"notes"},"contentHash":"194939704b23314011141116733dafdb","links":[],"anchors":{"links":{"type":"header","text":"Links","value":"links","line":7,"column":0,"depth":2},"github":{"type":"header","text":"GitHub","value":"github","line":8,"column":0,"depth":3},"linkedin":{"type":"header","text":"LinkedIn","value":"linkedin","line":9,"column":0,"depth":3},"frappe-forum":{"type":"header","text":"Frappe Forum","value":"frappe-forum","line":10,"column":0,"depth":3},"hackerrank":{"type":"header","text":"HackerRank","value":"hackerrank","line":11,"column":0,"depth":3},"youtube":{"type":"header","text":"YouTube","value":"youtube","line":12,"column":0,"depth":3}},"children":["ifoa0v25wh8cu1hxwdr9h42","5u88syeac813rvqauto8x7o","nc02voic3g7pn9o0vu5lyki","67vcv6zhh0cxazsfqlaai29","44oijwqa5kph6kobar7jckg","dcbhrrtovhg5rzaathh1vzo","15dblq3xeghfzhf4xy84qol","iyj5r87cpjx65khycaiepqo","zn57yzyn4u8t0upnvhlhh86","au5edemlol3d2awpbv9v95j","hjz2keujzwyj7ts555cxr3d","wn2fr0o5xhabmh5vfkevsvj","58xds0229zowl3885oqf38y"],"parent":null,"data":{},"body":"## Links\n### [GitHub](https://github.com/Robproject)\n### [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rodun/)\n### [Frappe Forum](https://discuss.frappe.io/u/roberp/summary)\n### [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/rodun?hr_r=1)\n### [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgzGBLm9bYFEFWi7_EzRB_g)"},"collectionChildren":null,"customHeadContent":null,"config":{"version":5,"dev":{"enablePreviewV2":true,"enableSelfContainedVaults":true},"commands":{"lookup":{"note":{"selectionMode":"extract","confirmVaultOnCreate":true,"vaultSelectionModeOnCreate":"smart","leaveTrace":false,"bubbleUpCreateNew":true,"fuzzThreshold":0.2}},"randomNote":{},"insertNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"none","enableMultiSelect":false},"insertNoteIndex":{"enableMarker":false},"copyNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"title"},"templateHierarchy":"template"},"workspace":{"vaults":[{"fsPath":".","selfContained":true,"name":"notes"}],"journal":{"dailyDomain":"daily","name":"journal","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd","addBehavior":"childOfDomain"},"scratch":{"name":"scratch","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd.HHmmss","addBehavior":"asOwnDomain"},"task":{"name":"task","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd","addBehavior":"asOwnDomain","statusSymbols":{"":" ","wip":"w","done":"x","assigned":"a","moved":"m","blocked":"b","delegated":"l","dropped":"d","pending":"y"},"taskCompleteStatus":["done","x"],"prioritySymbols":{"H":"high","M":"medium","L":"low"},"todoIntegration":false,"createTaskSelectionType":"selection2link"},"graph":{"zoomSpeed":1,"createStub":false},"enableAutoCreateOnDefinition":false,"enableXVaultWikiLink":false,"enableRemoteVaultInit":true,"enableUserTags":true,"enableHashTags":true,"workspaceVaultSyncMode":"noCommit","enableAutoFoldFrontmatter":false,"enableEditorDecorations":true,"maxPreviewsCached":10,"maxNoteLength":204800,"enableFullHierarchyNoteTitle":false},"preview":{"enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enableFrontmatterTags":true,"enableHashesForFMTags":false,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"automaticallyShowPreview":false},"publishing":{"enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"copyAssets":true,"siteHierarchies":["root"],"writeStubs":false,"siteRootDir":"docs","seo":{"title":"rodun","description":"homepage","author":"Robert Duncan","twitter":"https://twitter.com/rodunro"},"github":{"enableEditLink":true,"editLinkText":"Edit this page on GitHub","editBranch":"main","editViewMode":"tree"},"enableSiteLastModified":true,"enableFrontmatterTags":true,"enableHashesForFMTags":false,"enableRandomlyColoredTags":true,"enableTaskNotes":true,"enablePrettyLinks":true,"searchMode":"search","enableHierarchyDisplay":false,"siteIndex":"root","hierarchy":{"biology":{"publishByDefault":false,"customFrontmatter":[]},"civil":{"publishByDefault":false,"customFrontmatter":[]},"fitness":{"publishByDefault":false,"customFrontmatter":[]},"games":{"publishByDefault":false,"customFrontmatter":[]},"psychology":{"publishByDefault":false,"customFrontmatter":[]},"tags":{"publishByDefault":false,"customFrontmatter":[]}},"sidebarPath":"./sidebars/root.js","siteUrl":"https://rodun.dev","siteFaviconPath":"favicon.ico"}}},"__N_SSG":true}
